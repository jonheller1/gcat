-- Create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) database - one time step
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Oracle Cloud account.

Open this link to see the login screen: https://cloud.oracle.com/db/adb?region=us-ashburn-1

Choose oracleidentitycloudservice and click Continue to enter password.

Enter Username and Password to continue to Autonomous Database.

Click "Create Autonomous Database"

Change "Display name" and "Database name" to "gcat"

Keep the free options

Create and write down new password for "Create administrator credentials"

Keep the default connection options

Enter Contact Email

Click "Create Autonomous Database"

Wait about a minute for the database to provision and status to change to "Available"

Click on "DB Connection" to setup local connections

Change Wallet type to "Regional Wallet", so you will get metadata for all relevant instances.

Create and write down new password for the wallet and save the file.

Find the directory of your tnsnames.ora file by running this on your local command line:
	tnsping anything

Create a subdirectory named "gcatwallet" and copy the files from the downloaded ZIP file into that directory.

In that new subdirectory, open the tnsnames.ora file and copy the new gcat entries and paste them into your normal tnsnames.ora file.

Open your sqlnet.ora file and add a WALLET_LOCATION like this that refers to your new wallet subdirectory.
	WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = file) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY="D:\19c\WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home\network\admin\gcatwallet")))

You should be able to ping the new database from your local command line like this:
	tnsping gcat_low

You should be able to login to the new database like this:
	sqlplus ADMIN/(admin password from above)@gcat_low

(TODO: Create separate user for link, not ADMIN)
Create database link from local machine to GCAT admin:
	create database link gcat connect to admin identified by "<password from above>" using 'gcat_low';

Test database link:
	select * from dual@gcat;
